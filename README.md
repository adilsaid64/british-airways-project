## Task 1

First data was scrapped from [airline quality](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways) website. This was my first attempt at scrapping data and I was sucessful in scraping most of the data. However I was struggling with scraping the star ratings that users gave. To help, I used this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/minnikeswarrao/web-scraping-on-skytrax-com/notebook). 

The next stages inovled cleaning the data and checking for missing values.
